<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Closed Loop</li><li>Horizontal Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal heat pump market includes three main types: vertical closed loop, horizontal closed loop, and open loop systems. Vertical closed loop systems use deep boreholes to exchange heat with the ground, ideal for smaller properties with limited space. Horizontal closed loop systems lay pipes in trenches, suitable for larger areas where excavation is feasible. Open loop systems utilize groundwater directly as a heat source or sink, making them effective but reliant on water availability and quality. Each type offers unique advantages based on site conditions.</p></p>
