<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Ventilation Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Jet Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunnel ventilation fans are essential for maintaining air quality and safe conditions in underground environments. The market primarily consists of two types: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans are designed to move large volumes of air efficiently along the tunnel length, making them ideal for continuous air circulation. Jet fans, on the other hand, are used for creating high-velocity air streams, effectively controlling smoke and pollutants in emergencies. Both types enhance ventilation performance in transportation tunnels and mines.</p></p>
