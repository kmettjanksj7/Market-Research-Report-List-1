<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrically Operated Diaphragm Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrically operated diaphragm pumps are divided into two main types: single acting and double acting. Single acting diaphragm pumps discharge fluid during one stroke of the diaphragm and are ideal for lower flow applications. In contrast, double acting diaphragm pumps operate on both the upward and downward strokes, providing a more continuous flow and higher efficiency, making them suitable for demanding industrial applications. Both types are widely used across various sectors, including water treatment, chemical processing, and food production.</p></p>
